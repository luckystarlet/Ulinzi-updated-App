        <Section title="4. Emergency Services">
            Ulinzi is a tool to assist in emergency situations but is not a replacement for contacting emergency services directly (e.g., dialing 911, 999, 112). We do not guarantee that your emergency contacts will receive or respond to any alert.

        <Section title="5. Technology and Third-Party Services">
            Ulinzi relies on robust third-party services to deliver its core safety features. By using the app, you acknowledge the use of these services:
            {'\n\n'}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>Maps & Location:</Text> We use the Google Maps API to accurately determine and share your GPS location during an emergency.
            {'\n\n'}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>WhatsApp Notifications:</Text> For users with a data connection, emergency alerts may also be sent via the WhatsApp API for fast, free, and reliable delivery.
            {'\n\n'}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>Push Notifications:</Text> Emergency alerts are sent as push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging for immediate delivery when an internet connection is available.
            {'\n\n'}
            <Text style={styles.bold}>SMS & Calls Fallback:</Text> To ensure maximum reliability, if a push notification cannot be sent, the app will automatically fall back to sending an SMS alert using industry-leading providers like Twilio or Africaâ€™s Talking.
